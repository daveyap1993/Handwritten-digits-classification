# Handwritten-digits-classification
Handwritten digits classification with KNN and SVM Classifier in Python

In this project, I will build  classification models, includes KNN and SVM to predict a Handwritten Number. Furthermore, I will shows how to develop KNN Classifier for MNIST handwritten digits classification with GUI, where the user can draw a digit in the canvas and make the Machine Learning model predict the digit.

Dataset: MNIST Database
